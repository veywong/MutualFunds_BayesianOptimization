# Datasheet (based on Kaggle)
 
## Context
ETFs represent a cheap alternative to Mutual Funds and they are growing fast in the last years due to their passive approach (and the consequential lower fees).
This dataset includes the financial information collected from Yahoo Finance and includes all U.S. Mutual Funds and along with their historical prices.
Updated version relates to the 24 November 2021 financial values.

## Content
The file contains 23,783 Mutual Funds and 2,310 ETFs with:
General fund aspects (e.g. total_net_assets, fund family, inception date, etc.)
Portfolio indicators (e.g. cash, stocks, bonds, sectors, etc.)
Historical yearly and quarterly returns (e.g. year_to_date, 1-year, 3-years, etc.)
Financial ratios (price/earning, Treynor and Sharpe ratios, alpha, and beta)
ESG scores

## Acknowledgements
Data has been scraped from the publicly available website https://finance.yahoo.com.

## Inspiration
Datasets allow for multiple comparisons regarding portfolio decisions from investment managers in Mutual Funds and portfolio restrictions to the indexes in ETFs.
The inspiration comes from the 2017 hype regarding ETFs, that convinced many investors to invest in Exchange Traded Funds rather than in Mutual Funds.
Datasets will be updated every one or two semesters.
